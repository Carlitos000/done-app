# Done App

DoneApp is a site that aims to demonstrate how pure JavaScript works in a real world context. The site will be targeted toward people who need to list the tasks or pending activities in their day to day. This tool can be quite useful for the mind and planned tasks in the short term. It is the perfect accomplice that will remind you that you have activities or tasks you have planned for the day, which ones are already done and which ones are still pending.\
DoneApp is a fully responsive JavaScript based web application that will remind users to engage in their daily tasks.\
